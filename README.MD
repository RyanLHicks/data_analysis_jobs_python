# Data Jobs Python Project
## Introduction
#### Background
This is part of a 4 step learning journey for data analysis.  During this part, I am learning about Python and it's applications for data analysis. I am specefically using a data set from the job data market from 2023 to see which set of skills are preffered among employers through their job applications they post. Using this program, it will allow me to gain a better understanding of the market and developing my python coding skills that is widely used by professionals around the world. My goal is to use the same set of data throughout my journey, analyzing and extracting the data with with SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Python.
#### Goals
1. Find the most in demand skills for the top 3 data analyst roles.
2. Discover the trends for in demand data analyst skills.
3. Realize the earning potential each data job has.
4. Analyzing the skills, salaries, and job titles in a final step for decision making.
#### Plan
## Procedure
1. Top in demand skills for data analyst roles
After devising two main lines of code that defines the skill count and job titles, I will put them together with matplot library that I imported. I will then make another data extraction point for the percent presence for each skill and again combining it with the job title listed to get a picture of job skills and associated job titles.
